/* The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.

The following rules hold true for a variable declared using the const keyword âˆ’
1) Constants cannot be reassigned a value.
2) A constant cannot be re-declared.
3) A constant requires an initializer. This means constants must be initialized during its declaration.
4) The value assigned to a const variable is mutable.
